          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Derja, or Tunisian dialect, is a dialect of Arabic local to Tunisia. Its spread extends beyond the Tunisian country to reach the Algerian east and the Libyan west, as well as a number of European countries such as France, Italy, and Germany due to the migration of Tunisians. 
          A speaker of the Tunisian dialect can communicate with the Moroccan, the Algerian, and the Libyan without having to change his dialect due to the proximity of all these dialects to each other. 
          The Tunisian dialect is distinguished from other Arab dialects by pronouncing all the twenty-eight letters of the Arabic language.
          This website was made for people who want to learn this dialect online, due to a lack of resources (especially in English).
